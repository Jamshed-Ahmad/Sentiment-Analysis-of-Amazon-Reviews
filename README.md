# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Amazon-Reviews - A Machine Learning Approach

## 📝 Project Description <br>
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews to classify them as positive or negative. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, this project aims to understand customer feedback and draw insights from textual review data. <br>
🚀 Can machine learning help detect heart disease early? This project dives into predictive analytics, using real-world clinical data to assess heart disease risk. By leveraging data science, feature engineering, and model optimization, we aim to identify key health risk factors and build an accurate, explainable prediction model.<br>


## 📊 Problem Statement<br>
Customer reviews provide valuable insights into product satisfaction, but manually analyzing large volumes of text is inefficient. This project aims to automate the process of classifying reviews based on sentiment using supervised learning techniques. <br>

## 🧠 Key Objectives <br>
Preprocess and clean the text data.<br>
Visualize the most common words in positive and negative reviews.<br>
Transform text using techniques like TF-IDF.<br>
Train machine learning models such as:<br>
1. Logistic Regression<br>
2. Random Forest<br>
3. Gradient Boosting<br>
Evaluate models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.<br>
Predict sentiment for new/unseen Amazon reviews.<br>

## 📊 Model Performance & Accuracy <br>
| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|---------------------|
Logistic Regression | 83.0% <br>
SVM | 85.0% ✅ (Best Model)<br>
Decision Tree | 77.0% <br> 

🔹 Support Vector Machine achieved the highest accuracy (85.0%), making it the optimal choice for predictions. <br>

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies <br>
* Python<br>
* Pandas, NumPy – Data handling<br>
* Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization<br>
* NLTK, re (regex) – Text preprocessing<br>
* Scikit-learn – ML model building and evaluation<br>
* WordCloud – Visualizing word frequency <br>

## 🤝 Acknowledgements <br>
This project is part of my data science portfolio to demonstrate NLP and machine learning skills. The dataset is sourced from Amazon product reviews for educational purposes.<br>

## 🚀 How to Run the Project <br>
### 1️⃣ Running the Jupyter Notebook
1. Open `Heart Disease Risk Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells to:
   - Perform data preprocessing and EDA.
   - Train and evaluate different regression models.
   - Compare accuracy metrics.

 ### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies 
 pip install `-r requirements.txt`. 

### 3️⃣ Run the Gradio App 
`python app.py`. <br>
or, if using Jupyter Notebook: <br>
`!gradio app.py`. 

The Gradio interface will launch in your browser, allowing you to Sentimen Analysis dynamically. 

###🌟 Future Enhancements
🔹 Improve accuracy with advanced ensemble models 🏆.
🔹 Integrate real-time market trends 📈.
🔹 Deploy as a full-fledged web application 🌐.
